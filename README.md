## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

- **From Source:** Uses official `node:18` as the base.
- **Global Install:** Installs latest n8n (with npm) & Git (for pulling custom nodes).
- **Config:** Auto-sets port, protocol, and public URLs via environment variables.
- **Runs at Port 80:** No need to mess with ports — just access and go!

### Under the Hood:

1. 🛠️ Installs Git & n8n globally  
2. 📂 Creates required data folders  
3. 🌍 Exposes port 80  
4. 🏁 Starts n8n — ready for your workflows!
